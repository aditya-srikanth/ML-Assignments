# ML-Assignments
this repository contains our implementation of machine learning assignments given as part of our course
<p> The following fuctionality is to be implemented <\p>
<ul>
  <li> The Fisher Discriminent by finding Sw_inverse*(m2-m1) </li>
  <li> The perceptron by describing the error function and running gradient descent </li>
  <li> Visualizations for both of them </li>
  <li> The report for both </li>
</ul>
